# Trajectories of implication
## Material Production and Digital Environments in the Humanities and Social Sciences 


Research in humanities and social sciences is often driven by a social concern or a public issue. In these contexts, the researcher is pushed to build a trajectory of implication. With the term **‘trajectory of implications’**, we refer to a research trajectory that includes at least one phase where the researcher builds a relationship with ‘the outside’. 

With the term **‘outside’**, we refer to any actor who is not part of the research team carrying out the project (the ‘inside’). This can refer to other researchers, institutions, associations, companies, students and, of course, the citizen in general. 

So, **trajectories of implications are research paths that articulate moments where only the inside is involved with other moments where inside and outside are both implicated**. External actors can be involved in different ways: providing data, interpreting data and also cocreating the research protocol. 

In recent years, the emergence of digital tools and the dynamics of voluntary or involuntary **traceability of social life** (logs, mobile data, creation of content on the web and social media, etc.) have favoured the diffusion of these types of research trajectories in several disciplinary areas of the humanities and social sciences. However, these trajectories do not need the digital device to exist. They can rely on different types of material configurations mixing physical and digital media: focus groups, design thinking meetings, participatory platforms, crowdsourcing tools, research-creation activities, etc.

These trajectories have three common properties: 
They respond to a public issue or **social concern** (climate change, AI, disinformation, cancel culture, etc.)
They aim to create strategies of involvement of external actors related to the **research in progress** (and not just at the end of the research)
They are supported by the **social traceability** made possible by digital devices (logs, texts, media, traces that document the implication of the different actors in the trajectories) 

Trajectories of implications are particularly popular in **lab-type structures** (media labs, digital humanities labs, data labs, etc.) that ground their identity on the use of digital data and that are frequently solicited by decision makers for carrying out projects that involve external actors (at least in the phase of data collection). They are also used in citizen science projects whose research protocols are designed to involve citizens in the production of science. Yet, trajectories of implication can also be carried out by traditional research centers that can propose original material configurations for involving the outside.

Trajectories of implication are configured as research paths dotted with moments of external involvement that can take different **forms**:
- interfaces (e.g. artistic installations)
- experimental protocols (e.g. publication protocols) 
- devices (e.g. participatory platforms)
- events (e.g. hackathon)
- ….

The implication can be configured in **both directions**: 
- the research team (inside) can implicate in the research trajectory external actors or strategies from the outside  (e.g. reproduction of models from third places, play practices, etc.)
- external actors (outside) can be implicated in the research trajectories with different kinds of contribution (e.g. data, tasks, ideas, etc.)

Thus, trajectories of implication, which consist of moments of entry and exit from the classic research path, are moments of **knowledge production** in which the outside co-constructs with the inside.  What is interesting in these contexts is to observe the porosity and the role played by the material infrastructure: what is the role of the technical device? What is its transformative potential? What is the material configuration more favourable to the implication (in different contexts)?  

Coping with these new research trends, this call for participation aims to develop a **critical and collective reflection** on this new way of doing research in interaction with the outside that has spread in the humanities and social sciences. 
We aim at building:
An **observatory** of trajectories of implication
A **network** of researchers and professionals interested in investigating the materiality of these trajectories of implication and the choices implicit in this approach. 

In particular, we wish to explore the following aspects:
- The different **forms** that these trajectories can take
- The **interactions** between internal and external actors that they can generate
- The **materiality** of the socio-technical choices that are adopted


### How to participate

Do you cope with these questions in your research? Have you ever built a trajectory of implication? Or are you just intrigued by this approach?

You can join this project in three ways:
You can fill the questionnaire online describing your trajectory of implication (link)
You can contact us and we can organize an interview to fill the questionnaire together (msevero@parisnanterre.fr)
You can also contact us to obtain more information about the project and be involved even if you don’t have a project to share (msevero@parisnanterre.fr).

All people that will fill the questionnaire or accept the interview will be also proposed to make a video to represent the trajectory in a summarized way.
Results of the questionnaire/interview and the video will be published in the observatory.
All participants will be invited in a final event (juin 2023) in Paris to present their trajectories and share their experience.
After this event, a collective book will be prepared to present the identified trajectories.
